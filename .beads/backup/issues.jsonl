We can't wait 8+ minutes every time we want to run tests.\n\n# Root Cause Analysis\n\n## 1. Sheer Volume\n279 tests is too many for a single package. Even at 0.1s per test, that's 28 seconds minimum just for cmd/bd.\n\n## 2. Each Test Creates Full Database + Temp Directories\nEvery test does heavy setup:\n- Creates temp directory (`t.TempDir()` or `os.MkdirTemp`)\n- Initializes SQLite database\n- Sets up git repo in many cases\n- Creates full storage layer\n\nExample from the tests:\n```go\nfunc setupCLITestDB(t *testing.T) string {\n    tmpDir := createTempDirWithCleanup(t)\n    runBDInProcess(t, tmpDir, \"init\", \"--prefix\", \"test\", \"--quiet\")\n    return tmpDir\n}\n```\n\nThis happens 279 times!\n\n## 3. Tests Are Not Properly Categorized\nWe have three types of tests mixed together:\n- **Unit tests** - should be fast, test single functions\n- **Integration tests** - test full workflows, need DB/git\n- **End-to-end tests** - test entire CLI commands\n\nThey're all lumped together in cmd/bd, all running every time.\n\n# What We've Already Fixed\n\nAdded `integration` build tags to 16 obviously-slow test files:\n- import_profile_test.go (performance benchmarking tests)\n- export_mtime_test.go (tests with time.Sleep calls)\n- cli_fast_test.go (full CLI integration tests)\n- delete_test.go, import_uncommitted_test.go, sync_local_only_test.go (git integration)\n- And 10 more in internal/ packages\n\nThese are now excluded from the default `go test ./...` run.\n\n# Proposed Solutions\n\n## Option 1: Shared Test Fixtures (Quick Win)\nCreate a shared test database that multiple tests can use:\n```go\nvar testDB *sqlite.SQLiteStorage\nvar testDBOnce sync.Once\n\nfunc getSharedTestDB(t *testing.T) storage.Storage {\n    testDBOnce.Do(func() {\n        // Create one DB for all tests\n    })\n    return testDB\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Easy to implement, immediate speedup\n**Cons**: Tests become less isolated, harder to debug failures\n\n## Option 2: Table-Driven Tests (Medium Win)\nCollapse similar tests into table-driven tests:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate(t *testing.T) {\n    tests := []struct{\n        name string\n        args []string\n        want string\n    }{\n        {\"basic issue\", []string{\"create\", \"Test\"}, \"created\"},\n        {\"with description\", []string{\"create\", \"Test\", \"-d\", \"desc\"}, \"created\"},\n        // ... 50 more cases\n    }\n    \n    db := setupOnce(t) // Setup once, not 50 times\n    for _, tt := range tests {\n        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n            // test using shared db\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Dramatically reduces setup overhead, tests run in parallel\n**Cons**: Requires refactoring, tests share more state\n\n## Option 3: Split cmd/bd Tests Into Packages (Big Win)\nMove tests into focused packages:\n- `cmd/bd/internal/clitests` - CLI integration tests (mark with integration tag)\n- `cmd/bd/internal/unittests` - Fast unit tests\n- Keep only essential tests in cmd/bd\n\n**Pros**: Clean separation, easy to run just fast tests\n**Cons**: Requires significant refactoring\n\n## Option 4: Parallel Execution (Quick Win)\nAdd `t.Parallel()` to independent tests:\n```go\nfunc TestSomething(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel() // Run this test concurrently with others\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Easy to add, can cut time in half on multi-core machines\n**Cons**: Doesn't reduce actual test work, just parallelizes it\n\n## Option 5: In-Memory Databases (Medium Win)\nUse `:memory:` SQLite databases instead of file-based:\n```go\nstore, err := sqlite.New(ctx, \":memory:\")\n```\n\n**Pros**: Faster than disk I/O, easier cleanup\n**Cons**: Some tests need actual file-based DBs (export/import tests)\n\n# Recommended Approach\n\n**Short-term (this week)**:\n1. Add `t.Parallel()` to all independent tests in cmd/bd\n2. Use `:memory:` databases where possible\n3. Create table-driven tests for similar test cases\n\n**Medium-term (next sprint)**:\n4. Split cmd/bd tests into focused packages\n5. Mark more integration tests appropriately\n\n**Long-term (backlog)**:\n6. Consider shared test fixtures with proper isolation\n\n# Current Status\n\nWe've tagged 16 files with `integration` build tag, but the remaining 279 tests in cmd/bd still take 8+ minutes. This issue tracks fixing the cmd/bd test performance specifically.\n\n# Target\n\nGet `go test ./...` (without `-short` or `-tags=integration`) down to **under 30 seconds**.\n\n\n# THE REAL ROOT CAUSE (Updated Analysis)\n\nAfter examining the actual test code, the problem is clear:\n\n## Every Test Creates Its Own Database From Scratch\n\nLook at `create_test.go`:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate_BasicIssue(t *testing.T) {\n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()                          // ← Creates temp dir\n    testDB := filepath.Join(tmpDir, \".beads\", \"beads.db\")\n    s := newTestStore(t, testDB)                   // ← Opens NEW SQLite connection\n                                                    // ← Runs migrations\n                                                    // ← Sets config\n    // ... actual test (3 lines)\n}\n\nfunc TestCreate_WithDescription(t *testing.T) {\n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()                          // ← Creates ANOTHER temp dir\n    testDB := filepath.Join(tmpDir, \".beads\", \"beads.db\")\n    s := newTestStore(t, testDB)                   // ← Opens ANOTHER SQLite connection\n    // ... actual test (3 lines)\n}\n```\n\n**This happens 279 times!**\n\n## These Tests Don't Need Isolation!\n\nMost tests are just checking:\n- \"Can I create an issue with a title?\"\n- \"Can I create an issue with a description?\"\n- \"Can I add labels?\"\n\nThey don't conflict with each other. They could all share ONE database!\n\n## The Fix: Test Suites with Shared Setup\n\nInstead of:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate_BasicIssue(t *testing.T) {\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")  // ← Expensive!\n    // test\n}\n\nfunc TestCreate_WithDesc(t *testing.T) {\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")  // ← Expensive!\n    // test\n}\n```\n\nDo this:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate(t *testing.T) {\n    // ONE setup for all subtests\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")\n    \n    t.Run(\"basic_issue\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        t.Parallel()  // Can run concurrently - tests don't conflict\n        // test using shared `s`\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"with_description\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        t.Parallel()\n        // test using shared `s`\n    })\n    \n    // ... 50 more subtests, all using same DB\n}\n```\n\n**Result**: 50 tests → 1 database setup instead of 50!\n\n## Why This Works\n\nSQLite is fine with concurrent reads and isolated transactions. These tests:\n- ✅ Create different issues (no ID conflicts)\n- ✅ Just read back what they created\n- ✅ Don't depend on database state from other tests\n\nThey SHOULD share a database!\n\n## Real Numbers\n\nCurrent:\n- 279 tests × (create dir + init SQLite + migrations) = **8 minutes**\n\nAfter fix:\n- 10 test suites × (create dir + init SQLite + migrations) = **30 seconds**\n- 279 subtests running in parallel using those 10 DBs = **5 seconds**\n\n**Total: ~35 seconds instead of 8 minutes!**\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Group related tests** into suites (Create, List, Update, Delete, etc.)\n2. **One setup per suite** instead of per test\n3. **Use t.Run() for subtests** with t.Parallel()\n4. **Keep tests that actually need isolation** separate (export/import tests, git operations)\n\nThis is way better than shuffling tests into folders!","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"bd-1rh","is_template":0,"issue_type":"bug","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"Analysis: The test panic in TestInitAlreadyInitialized is caused by store.Close() in PersistentPostRun setting s.db=nil, then subsequent HasRemote() call accessing the nil db.

Check: flag plumbing correctness, wisp creation with root_only=true, no children created, backward compatibility.","design":"## Code Review: --root-only flag in bd mol wisp create (725f6bbb)\n\n**Verdict: LGTM — clean commit, no blocking issues.**\n\n### 1. Flag Plumbing Correctness ✅\n\n- `--root-only` registered on both `wispCmd` and `wispCreateCmd` (backward compat for both CLI paths)\n- Read via `cmd.Flags().GetBool(\"root-only\")` at wisp.go\n- Passed through `CloneOptions{RootOnly: rootOnly}` → `spawnMoleculeWithOptions` → `cloneSubgraph`\n- Full pipeline verified end-to-end\n\n### 2. Wisp Creation with root_only=true ✅\n\n- `cloneSubgraph` narrows `issuesToCreate = []*types.Issue{subgraph.Root}` when RootOnly is set\n- Root issue goes through the identical creation path (assignee override, variable substitution, ephemeral marking, bonded ID generation)\n- `idMapping` correctly contains exactly one entry (root only)\n\n### 3. No Children Created ✅\n\n- Children are excluded from `issuesToCreate` (only root is in the slice)\n- Dependencies are skipped via `if opts.RootOnly { break }` in the second pass\n- AttachToID still works (uses `idMapping[subgraph.Root.ID]` which is always populated)\n- Dynamic bonding (`ParentID`) also works — root gets bonded ID as expected\n\n### 4. Backward Compatibility ✅\n\n- `spawnMolecule()` function is preserved — all existing callers (pour.go:216, 9 test call sites in mol_test.go) are unaffected\n- Default `RootOnly` is `false` (Go zero value), so existing `CloneOptions{}` usage safe\n- Dry-run path properly branches: root-only shows single-line summary with inlined step count; non-root-only path is unchanged\n\n### 5. `Created` Field Fix ✅\n\n- Changed from `len(subgraph.Issues)` to `len(idMapping)` — more accurate in ALL cases\n- For non-root-only: `len(idMapping)` == `len(subgraph.Issues)` in all success paths (errors cause tx rollback)\n- For root-only: correctly returns 1 instead of the full template count\n- This is a semantic improvement, not just a root-only fix\n\n### Minor Nit (Non-Blocking)\n\nThe dependency loop guard:\n```go\nfor _, dep := range subgraph.Dependencies {\n    if opts.RootOnly { break }\n    ...\n}\n```\nWould be slightly cleaner as:\n```go\nif !opts.RootOnly {\n    for _, dep := range subgraph.Dependencies { ... }\n}\n```\nFunctionally identical — the `break` fires on first iteration and exits. But wrapping the loop is more idiomatic Go. Not worth a re-spin.\n\n### Summary\n\nTwo files changed (+39/-9), well-scoped. The ~15x Dolt write reduction claim is plausible (typical patrol formula has 10+ steps). All edge cases (bonding, attachment, dry-run, backward compat) are covered.","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"bd-a3j","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"steve.yegge@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":1,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Code review: --root-only flag in bd mol wisp create (725f6bbb)","updated_at":"2026-02-27T05:52:24Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

HARDCODED INFRA TYPES - Go code making agent-level decisions (2 locations)\n- ephemeral_routing.go:22-27 - IsInfraType hardcodes \"agent\", \"rig\", \"role\", \"message\"\n- migrations/007_infra_to_wisps.go:11 - infraTypes duplicates the same list\n\nThe storage layer DECIDES which types are \"infrastructure\" and routes them\nto the wisps table. This is a policy decision that should be agent-configurable,\nnot hardcoded in Go. If Gas Town adds a new infra type (e.g., \"formula\", \"slot\"),\na code change + release is required.\n\n### 3. HARDCODED STATUS LISTS IN SQL VIEWS (schema.go)\n- schema.go:279 - ready_issues view: IN (open, in_progress, blocked, deferred, hooked)\n- schema.go:326 - blocked_issues view: IN (open, in_progress, blocked, deferred, hooked)\n- dependencies.go:779 - IsBlocked: IN (open, in_progress, blocked, deferred, hooked)\n- dependencies.go:834 - GetNewlyUnblockedByClose: IN (open, blocked)\n- dependencies.go:877 - GetNewlyUnblockedByClose: IN (open, in_progress, blocked, deferred, hooked)\n\nCustom statuses (config key \"status.custom\") are supported for validation but\nNOT reflected in these SQL views. A custom status like \"review\" would be\ninvisible to the ready_issues view, making issues with that status permanently\ninvisible to GetReadyWork.\n\n### 4. HARDCODED STATUS IN COMPACT.GO - Go code deciding agent logic\n- compact.go:35 - status != \"closed\" check uses string literal instead of types.StatusClosed\n- compact.go:49,59 - Magic numbers for compaction days (30, 90) hardcoded, though\n  config keys exist (compact_tier1_days, compact_tier2_days) they are not read.\n\n### 5. STRING-MATCHING ON WISP CONTENT - ephemeral_routing.go\n- ephemeral_routing.go:15 - IsEphemeralID checks strings.Contains(id, \"-wisp-\")\n\nThis is a convention-based routing that breaks when wisps have explicit IDs\n(GH#2053 noted in code). The code already has workarounds (isActiveWisp,\npartitionByWispStatus) but the fundamental pattern of routing by ID substring\nis fragile.\n\n### 6. DOLT-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS THAT BREAK PORTABILITY\n- store.go:848 - CALL DOLT_COMMIT during schema init\n- versioned.go:52-62 - dolt_diff(), AS OF, DOLT_HASHOF() - Dolt-only functions\n- versioned.go:142 - dolt_branches table query\n- federation.go:19 - DOLT_PUSH, DOLT_PULL, DOLT_FETCH - Dolt procedures\n- versioned.go:253 - DOLT_CONFLICTS_RESOLVE procedure\n- store.go:795-796 - CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS with Dolt catalog race workarounds\n- history.go:83-86 - dolt_history_issues table (Dolt-specific virtual table)\n- versioned.go:204-212 - dolt_log table query\n\nThe Storage interface (storage.go) is clean, but the concrete Dolt implementation\nuses Dolt-specific stored procedures and virtual tables extensively. If a\nnon-Dolt backend were added, the versioned/federation features would need\nseparate interface extension points.\n\n### 7. HARDCODED DEFAULT CONFIG VALUES (schema.go:250-263)\n- defaultConfig embeds specific defaults: compact_model = \"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\",\n  compact_batch_size = 50, types.custom = specific list including \"molecule,gate,convoy...\"\n- These are Gas Town operational constants baked into the storage layer schema init.\n\n### Non-issues (well-designed patterns)\n- Custom types/statuses: config.go reads from DB config table with YAML fallback - good\n- issue_scan.go: Centralized scan via issueSelectColumns - avoids column drift\n- configfile.go: All server params have env var overrides - good for portability\n- transactions.go: Clean interface with proper commit semantics\n- Test database firewall: Pattern-based guard against test pollution - solid defense","original_size":null,"owner":"steve.yegge@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Code review: storage layer for hardcoded assumptions and ZFC violations","updated_at":"2026-02-28T02:49:48Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Run 'bd preflight --fix' to auto-fix where possible.\n\n### Tier 3: Fix Mode (v3)\n\n    $ bd preflight --fix\n    ✓ Updated vendorHash in default.nix\n    ⚠ Cannot auto-fix beads pollution - manual review needed\n\n## Checks to Implement\n\n| Check | Description | Auto-fixable |\n|-------|-------------|--------------|\n| tests | Run go test -short ./... | No |\n| lint | Run golangci-lint | Partial (gofmt) |\n| beads-pollution | Detect personal issues in diff | No (see bd-umbf) |\n| nix-hash | Detect stale vendorHash | Yes (if nix available) |\n| version-sync | version.go matches default.nix | Yes |\n| no-debug | No TODO/FIXME/console.log | Warn only |\n| clean-stage | No unintended files staged | Warn only |\n\n## Future: Configuration\n\nMake checks configurable per-project via .beads/preflight.yaml:\n\n    preflight:\n      checks:\n        - name: tests\n          run: go test -short ./...\n          required: true\n        - name: no-secrets\n          pattern: \"**/*.env\"\n          staged: deny\n        - name: custom-check\n          run: ./scripts/validate.sh\n\nThis lets any project using beads define their own preflight checks.\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Static Checklist\n- Implement bd preflight with hardcoded checklist for beads\n- No execution, just prints what to check\n- Update CONTRIBUTING.md to reference it\n\n### Phase 2: Automated Checks\n- Implement bd preflight --check\n- Run tests, lint, detect stale hashes\n- Clear pass/fail/warn output\n\n### Phase 3: Auto-fix\n- Implement bd preflight --fix\n- Fix vendorHash, version sync\n- Integrate with bd-umbf solution for pollution\n\n### Phase 4: Configuration\n- .beads/preflight.yaml support\n- Make it useful for other projects using beads\n- Plugin/hook system for custom checks\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- bd-umbf: Namespace isolation for beads pollution (blocking for full solution)\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- Fewer CI failures on first PR push\n- Reduced \"fix nix hash\" commits\n- Contributors report preflight caught issues before CI","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"bd-lfak","is_template":0,"issue_type":"epic","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"bd preflight: PR readiness checks for contributors","updated_at":"2026-02-26T20:45:26Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Check: migration safety guards, old-schema compatibility, doctor recovery logic, error handling.","design":"## Code Review: SQLite-to-Dolt Migration Safety (49aed46c)\n\n### Summary\nWell-structured, safety-first migration PR. 18 files, ~3200 lines added, 117+ tests. The four review areas are analyzed below.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Migration Safety Guards — GOOD with one weakness\n\n**backupSQLite**: Solid. O_EXCL prevents TOCTOU races, 0600 permissions, counter-based collision handling up to 100 retries.\n\n**verifyServerTarget**: WEAK CHECK. Despite the name, it cannot actually prevent writing to the wrong project's Dolt server. It only catches: (a) non-MySQL services on the port, (b) unreachable servers with non-ECONNREFUSED errors. If another project's Dolt server is on the same port, this check passes — database doesn't exist yet = 'safe'. The function always returns nil for the normal first-migration case. Recommend: at minimum, add a comment acknowledging this limitation. Better: check for unexpected databases that indicate a different project's server.\n\n**verifyMigrationCounts**: Correct. Uses \u003e= semantics for idempotent re-runs.\n\n**finalizeMigration**: Good overall. Comment says 'atomic metadata update' but it's not truly atomic — crash between cfg.Save() and os.Rename() leaves metadata pointing to dolt while beads.db still exists. MITIGATED: doctor CheckBrokenMigrationState detects and fixes this exact scenario. Recommend: update comment to say 'near-atomic' and reference the doctor fix.\n\n**rollbackMetadata**: Simple and correct.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Old-Schema Compatibility — GOOD\n\nBoth CGO (migrate_dolt.go) and shim (migrate_shim.go) extract paths updated consistently with identical column lists using the DRY opt() helper.\n\nGood: created_by and owner changed from direct scan to sql.NullString scan for old schemas where these columns may not exist.\n\nMinor issue: migrate_dolt.go comment says 'Core columns (id, title, status, priority, created_at, updated_at) are assumed present in all versions' but then uses opt('title', '\"\"') — making title optional contradicts the comment. Comment should be corrected or removed.\n\nTested against 12 real-world databases spanning multiple schema versions — strong validation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Doctor Recovery Logic — GOOD\n\n**CheckBrokenMigrationState**: Properly aware of server mode (no false positive when dolt/ dir absent). Checks both beads.db and beads.db.migrated as recovery sources. Distinguishes recoverable vs unrecoverable states.\n\n**CheckSQLiteResidue**: Guards against renaming active SQLite database (checks backend first). Handles zero-byte files correctly.\n\n**CheckEmbeddedModeConcurrency**: Checks dolt-access.lock and noms LOCK files. Appropriately uses warnings not errors.\n\n**fix/BrokenMigrationState**: Re-verifies conditions before applying (defense in depth). Handles .migrated file recovery. Sets database='beads.db' correctly for SQLite backend.\n\n**fix/SQLiteResidue**: Guards against overwriting existing .migrated file. Backend guard prevents accidental rename on SQLite backend.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Error Handling — GOOD\n\nEvery failure point in migrate_auto.go and migrate_shim.go includes the backup path in error messages — users always know where their data is.\n\nRollback on verification failure properly removes dolt dir + restores metadata. Import failure cleanup removes the dolt directory that was just created.\n\nmain.go SQLite backend guard provides clear error message with migration instructions and BEADS_BACKEND override as escape hatch.\n\nconfigfile.go GetBackend priority chain (env \u003e config \u003e default) is correct with case-insensitive normalization and unrecognized-value warnings.\n\nMinor: migrate_auto.go has redundant doltPath assignment (computed twice to same value). Harmless.\n\nMinor: shim path uses cfg.GetDoltServerPort() directly while auto path uses doltserver.DefaultConfig(). These could diverge if GetDoltServerPort() returns 0, but verifyServerTarget handles port==0 by returning nil, so safe.\n\n---\n\n### Issues Found (non-blocking)\n\n1. **verifyServerTarget is weak** — cannot detect wrong-project Dolt servers (design limitation, mitigated by manual inspection)\n2. **Comment/code mismatch** in migrate_dolt.go re 'core columns assumed present' vs all columns using opt()\n3. **Redundant doltPath assignment** in migrate_auto.go (harmless)\n4. **'Atomic' finalization isn't truly atomic** — mitigated by doctor fix\n\n### Verdict: APPROVE with minor suggestions\nNo blocking issues. The safety model (backup-first, verify-then-finalize, doctor-recoverable) is sound. Test coverage is comprehensive at 117+ tests across unit and integration.","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"bd-on8","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"Code review complete.

They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, inactive 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, inactive 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone.

Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress?

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Mayor - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \\\"ORPHAN_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: orphaned (crashed before self-nuke)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Orphaned polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, inactive 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, inactive 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress?

If dirty: Create cleanup wisp for manual intervention\n\n```bash\n# The handler does this automatically:\n# - For clean state: gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e → archive mail\n# - For dirty state: create wisp → process in next step\n```\n\nCleanup wisps are only created when something is wrong (uncommitted changes,\nunpushed commits). Most POLECAT_DONE messages result in immediate nuke.\n\n**MERGED**:\nA branch was merged successfully. This is informational in the ephemeral model\nsince the polecat was already nuked after MR submission.\n\nIf a cleanup wisp exists (dirty state), complete the cleanup:\n```bash\n# Find the cleanup wisp for this polecat\nbd list --wisp --labels=polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n\n# If found, proceed with full polecat nuke:\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n\n# Burn the cleanup wisp\nbd close \u003cwisp-id\u003e\n```\nArchive after cleanup is complete.\n\n**HELP / Blocked**:\nAssess the request. Can you help? If not, escalate to Mayor:\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e needs help\" -m \"\u003cdetails\u003e\"\n```\nArchive after handling (escalated or resolved):\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n```\n\n**HANDOFF**:\nRead predecessor context. Continue from where they left off.\nArchive after absorbing context:\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n```\n\n**SWARM_START**:\nMayor initiating batch polecat work. Initialize swarm tracking.\n```bash\n# Parse swarm info from mail body: {\"swarm_id\": \"batch-123\", \"beads\": [\"bd-a\", \"bd-b\"]}\nbd create --wisp --title \"swarm:\u003cswarm_id\u003e\" --description \"Tracking batch: \u003cswarm_id\u003e\" --labels swarm,swarm_id:\u003cswarm_id\u003e,total:\u003cN\u003e,completed:0,start:\u003ctimestamp\u003e\n```\nArchive after creating swarm tracking wisp:\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n```\n\n**Hygiene principle**: Archive messages after they're fully processed.\nKeep only: active work, unprocessed requests.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Mayor - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \\\"ORPHAN_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: orphaned (crashed before self-nuke)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Orphaned polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, inactive 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, inactive 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Mayor - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \\\"ORPHAN_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: orphaned (crashed before self-nuke)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Orphaned polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, inactive 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, inactive 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads.
