// httpSweeper serves issueops.Sweeper from the sweepIssues custom method
// (design D8 row 12) — the capability behind `bd purge` and `bd prune`.
//
// The mapping is NOT total, unlike bd-enterprise's: OSS's apigen.SweepRequest
// publishes tier, closed_before, pattern, protect_referenced, dry_run and
// actor, with no member for ProtectLiveDependents or Limit, and
// apigen.SweepResult carries no remaining member for SweepResult.Remaining to
// decode out of. Both refuse before the dial (W-SweepRequest.ProtectLiveDependents,
// W-SweepRequest.Limit) rather than silently running an unprotected or
// unbounded sweep, so SweepResult.Remaining is always zero from this client —
// never a dropped count, since a Limit refuses before anything could be left
// over to report.
//
// WHAT IS NOT DECIDED HERE, deliberately: the require-a-filter gate, the glob's
// well-formedness and the tier's own predicate. All three are the ROLE's, they
// live below the server's handler, and the server routes this request through
// the same issueops.Sweeper a local workspace uses — so re-deciding any of them
// client-side would be a second definition of the rule that keeps a workspace's
// history from being erased by an omission. They come back as
// issueops.ErrValidation, which is what the role's contract promises.
//
// The ONE thing decided here is the tier VOCABULARY, because the tier is an
// enum on the wire and this client has to map it. An unrecognized tier refuses
// before the dial rather than as a 400, which is the rule every other write on
// this surface follows for a request its own contract calls invalid.
