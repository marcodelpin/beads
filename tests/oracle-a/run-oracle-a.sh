# Oracle A — refactor-safety differential conformance for Go bd.
#
# Runs the SAME curated contract scenarios against:
#   REFERENCE  bd  — built from the merge base of HEAD and origin/main (the "before")
#   CANDIDATE  bd  — built from the current working tree      (the "after")
# and diffs each step (exit code, stderr, JSON-aware stdout) with volatile
# normalization (<TS>/<UUID>/<ACTOR>/<EMAIL>). ZERO in-scope divergences is the
# gate: any in-scope FAIL means the change altered a user-visible bd behavior on
# the covered contract surface.
#
# The differential is driven by the Rust conformance harness under harness/
# (see harness/PROVENANCE.md); the harness is pointed at two Go bd binaries and
# treats each as a black box.
#
# Usage:
#   tests/oracle-a/run-oracle-a.sh              # ref = merge-base(HEAD, origin/main), candidate = working tree
#   REF_REF=<gitref> tests/oracle-a/run-oracle-a.sh   # override the reference ref
#   KEEP_ARTIFACTS=1 tests/oracle-a/run-oracle-a.sh    # keep the scratch build dir
#
# Requirements: cargo (Rust), a CGO toolchain (gcc), go. See README.md.
#
# Exit status: 0 = 100% in-scope pass; 1 = at least one in-scope divergence;
#              2 = setup/build error (could not produce a result).
